# ML strategies to control prosthetic arm
Experiment to investigate how to improve the recognition accuracy and userâ€™s understanding of the ML systems.

3 modes of learning
1. The system cues gesture classes randomly (control), 
2. The user selects gesture classes (teacher-led), 
3. The system queries gesture classes based on their separability in classifier space (learner-led).

Running the code: 
Myo-Python is required 

1. command to launch Marcelle app: npm run dev  
2. command to launch Marcelle backend: npm run backend
3. run python server.py
4. starting page is called start.html, choose a user training strategy and click on 'Go to Page' button

### npm run dev

Runs the app in the development mode.
